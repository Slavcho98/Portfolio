# Workout App

## Overview
The **Workout App** is a JavaScript-based project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This app allows users to log their workout activities by selecting a location on a map and entering details for either a **Running** or **Cycling** workout. The app is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for tracking fitness activities.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Users can click anywhere on the map to select a workout location.
- **Workout Options**: Choose between logging a **Running** or **Cycling** workout.
- **Form Input**: Enter workout details such as distance, duration, and additional information (like cadence for running or elevation gain for cycling).
- **Workout Display**: Display a summary of the workout on the map with relevant data.
- **Data Persistence**: Workout data is stored locally, allowing users to view past workouts when revisiting the app.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (OOP)**: The app is structured using classes to manage workout data and interactions.
- **Leaflet.js**: A popular JavaScript library for interactive maps, used to handle map rendering and location selection.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application interface.
- **Local Storage**: To store and retrieve workout data locally.
