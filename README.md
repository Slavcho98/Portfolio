<h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>

<description>
 This project is a modern web application built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, utilizing Supabase for backend services, data storage, and authentication. The frontend is developed using Material UI for a sleek and responsive user interface. Users can change their settings and profile picture seamlessly. The application includes sign-up and login functionality, allowing users to access their accounts easily. React Query is employed for efficient data fetching and caching, while React Hook Form ensures smooth and scalable form handling. The application also includes fully implemented CRUD operations for comments and replies, allowing users to interact with content, provided they are authenticated. The project leverages the Vite build tool for optimal performance and fast development experience, incorporating modern libraries for a robust and maintainable solution.

## Features

- **Modern TypeScript:** Built with TypeScript for strong typing, scalability, and catching errors at compile time.
- **React:** Developed with React for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Material UI:** Styled with Material UI components for a consistent, sleek, and responsive design.
- **Vite:** Leveraged Vite for fast and efficient development and build processes, ensuring optimal performance.
- **React Query:** Efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization using React Query, improving app performance and UX.
- **Supabase Integration:** Connected with Supabase for database and authentication functionalities.
- **React Hook Form:** Simplified form handling with validation and error management using React Hook Form.
- **CRUD Operations for Comments and Replies:** Users can create, read, update, and delete comments and replies if they are authenticated.
- **Profile Customization:** Users can change their profile picture and update their settings seamlessly.
- **Sign-Up and Login Functionality:** Users can sign up and log in to access their accounts and personalized features.
  

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies if they are missing using npm:

- cd **MHRA**
- Navigate to the **Project_03** branch.
- Run **npm init.**
- Run **npm install.**
- Run **npm run dev.**

- **Sign-up enhancements:** For testing purposes, utilize temporary email services like **temp-mail.org**. Since Supabase limited email confirmation codes due to security reasons you can sign up the user without confirming the email. Alternatively, existing credentials can be used:

- **Login** xetavac360@konetas.com and User123@.

## Things to Improve in the Future

While the project is functional, there are several areas that can be improved in the future:

- **Refactor the code for comments and replies:** Improve the structure and organization of the comments and replies code to enhance maintainability and readability.
- **Responsive Design:** Improve responsive design, ensure that the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, enhancing usability on mobile and tablet views.
